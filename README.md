# Real-time-Monitoring-System-for-Rideau-Canal-Skateway

## Scenario Description

The Rideau Canal Skateway in Ottawa, Ontario attracts worldwide visitors as it presents itself as the longest naturally frozen skating rink on Earth. Thousands of residents together with tourists make use of the canal during every winter season for activity purposes and for transportation needs. Public safety monitoring becomes necessary due to changing climate conditions that require constant ice surface analyses.

This project establishes a constant ice condition monitoring system which provides updated reports regarding canal ice conditions. As employee of National Capital Commission you will create a model to replicate Internet of Things (IoT) sensors which will be stationed at critical points along the skateway route.

These sensors capture vital environmental metrics such as:
- Ice Thickness (cm) : A meter uses to measure ice depth for determining skating safety.
- Surface Temperature (°C) : Measures the status between ice preservation and the beginning of its melting process.
- Snow Accumulation (cm) : Ice thickness determines the accumulation of snow that creates hazardous conditions for vision and safety on the ice.
- External Temperature (°C) : Weather conditions create the contextual framework that challenges ice structural stability.
